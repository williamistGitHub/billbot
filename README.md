=========
a very random discord bot

it does very random things

you can [invite it with this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1189005536298012672&permissions=32768&scope=bot+applications.commands)
or by clicking the "add app" button when viewing the bots
profile.

## commands

### greytext
generates a greytext image

### 1984ify
puts the supplied image/gif into 1984

## development
for now i just commit to the `main` branch, probably not great
but meh i'll change it if i need to lol.

the `live` branch is automatically pulled by the live bot when
it restarts, so it represents the code that is or will be used
by the official bot.
